    Here's a simple recipe to make delicious pancakes at home:

    **Ingredients:**

    * 1 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour
    * 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
    * 1 teaspoon salt
    * 1 tablespoon (14g) white sugar
    * 1 1/4 cups (300ml) milk (room temperature)
    * 1 egg (room temperature)
    * 3 tablespoons (42g) butter, melted

    **Instructions:**

    1. **Combine the dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

    2. **Make a well:** Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients.

    3. **Add the wet ingredients:** Pour in the milk, egg, and melted butter; mix until smooth.

    4. **Rest the batter:** Let the batter rest for 5 minutes. This helps with creating fluffy pancakes.

    5. **Preheat the pan:** Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. The surface is ready when a few drops of water sizzle and dance around.

    6. **Cook the pancakes:** For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle. Cook each side for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Flip when the surface is bubbly and the edges are slightly dry.

    7. **Serve:** Enjoy your pancakes fresh off the griddle with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or butter.

    ** Tips:**

    * For evenly cooked and perfectly round pancakes, use a pancake ring or create one using a clean, empty tuna can with both ends removed.
    * To keep pancakes warm while cooking the rest, place them on a baking sheet in a 200°F (93°C) oven until ready to serve.
    * For fun and unique pancakes, consider adding mix-ins like chocolate chips, blueberries, or bananas to the batter.
