    Sure, I'd be happy to help you make pancakes! Here's a simple recipe for you:

    **Ingredients:**

    1. 1 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour
    2. 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
    3. 1 teaspoon salt
    4. 1 tablespoon (14g) white sugar
    5. 1 1/4 cups (300ml) milk ( room temperature)
    6. 1 egg (room temperature)
    7. 3 tablespoons (42g) butter, melted

    **Instructions:**

    1. **Combine the dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

    2. **Make a well:** Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients.

    3. **Add the wet ingredients:** Pour the milk, egg, and melted butter into the well. Whisk the wet ingredients together, then incorporate them into the dry ingredients until smooth.

    4. **Rest the batter:** Let the batter rest for 5 minutes. This helps with creating fluffy pancakes.

    5. **Preheat the pan:** Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. The surface is ready when a few drops of water sizzle and dance around.

    6. **Cook the pancakes:** For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle. Cook each side for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Flip when the surface is bubbly and the edges are slightly dry.

    7. **Serve:** Enjoy your pancakes fresh off the griddle with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or butter.

    This recipe makes about 8 to 10 pancakes, depending on the size of the pancakes and the pan used. Enjoy your breakfast! Remember, cooking times and temperatures may vary depending on your specific stove and equipment.
