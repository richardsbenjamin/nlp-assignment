    Certainly! Here's a simple recipe for cooking classic pancakes:

    ### Ingredients:
    - 1 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour
    - 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
    - 1 teaspoon salt
    - 1 tablespoon (14g) white sugar
    - 1 1/4 cups (300ml) milk
    - 1 egg
    - 3 tablespoons (42g) butter, melted

    ### Instructions:

    1. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**
    - In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

    2. **Make a Well:**
    - Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.

    3. **Add Wet Ingredients:**
    - Pour the milk, egg, and melted butter into the well.

    4. **Mix:**
    - Mix until smooth. The batter should be slightly lumpy.

    5. **Heat the Pan:**
    - Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can test the heat by flicking a few drops of water onto the pan. If the water dances and sizzles, the pan is ready.

    6. **Pour the Batter:**
    - For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle. Use the back of a spoon or ladle to spread the batter into a circle if needed.

    7. **Cook:**
    - Cook each side for 2 to 3 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown.

    8. **Serve:**
    - Serve hot with your choice of toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, butter, or whipped cream.

    ### Tips:
    - For fluffier pancakes, let the batter rest for a few minutes before cooking.
    - To keep pancakes warm while you cook the rest, place them on a baking sheet in a 200°F (93°C) oven.
    - Feel free to add mix-ins like blueberries, chocolate chips, or banana slices to the batter for variety.

    Enjoy your pancakes!
